# Framework

## Overview

We believe that the barrier to entry for robust, programmatic hardware verification is too high and that the tools available today are not up to the task without a custom solution.
That's why we set out to build a framework that makes creating and maintaining HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) and SIL (software-in-the-loop) verification environments as painless as possible.

### Objectives

- Ease of use
  - We want to make it easy for users to get started virtualizing test environments by providing simple and intuitive interfaces and abstractions.
- Flexibility
  - Environments and testcases should be HIL and SIL agnostic, allowing for flexible execution.
- Scalability
  - Environments are designed to be deployed horizontally to support high change-throughput.
- Performance
  - We want to ensure that the framework is fast and efficient to minimize the use of contentious hardware and software resources.
- Security
  - Our top priority. On-premises deployment and self-hosted models are available to ensure that sensitive data is protected.
