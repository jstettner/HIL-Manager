# Framework

## Overview

We believe that the barrier to entry for robust, programmatic hardware verification is too high and that the tools available today are not up to the task without a custom solution.
That's why we set out to build a framework that makes creating and maintaining HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) and HOL (hardware-out-of-the-loop) verification environments as painless as possible.

### Objectives

- Ease of use
  - We want to make it easy for users to get started virtualizing test environments by providing simple and intuitive interfaces and abstractions.
- Flexibility
  - Environments and testcases should be HIL and HOL agnostic, allowing for flexible execution.
- Scalability
  - Environments are designed to be deployed horizontally to support high change-throughput.
- Performance
  - We want to ensure that the framework is fast and efficient to minimize the use of contentious hardware and software resources.
- Security
  - Our top priority. On-premises deployment and self-hosted models are available to ensure that sensitive data is protected.

# Getting Started

The Halidom Framework is currently in private beta and is available for early access. To learn more about how Halidom can be integrated into your workflow, please contact us at [founders@halidom.ai](mailto:founders@halidom.ai).
