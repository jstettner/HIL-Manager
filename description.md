## Key Features

### Test Case Sidebar

- Vertical navigation displaying test cases with status-coded styling:
  - **Red** for failed tests
  - **Green** for passed tests
  - **Blue** for in-progress or neutral tests
- Each item features subtle status-matched glow effects
- Hover interactions reveal tooltips with:
  - Test case descriptions and testbed information
  - Test metadata (ID, timestamps, queue time, execution duration)
- Scrollable interface for managing large test suites

### Data Visualization Panel

- Interactive D3.js graphs rendering selected test case data
- Features include:
  - Raw data point visualization
  - Insight annotations (thresholds, anomalies, highlights)
  - Dynamic zoom, pan, and tooltip interactions
  - Real-time updates on test case selection

### UI/UX Design

- Dark minimalist theme using ShadCn components
- Consistent styling matching the reference dashboard design
- Clean typography and subtle animations for state changes
- Responsive layout adapting to various screen sizes:
  - Collapsible sidebar for mobile views
  - Touch-optimized controls for mobile interaction

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack

- **Next.js (React 18+)**: Application framework
- **D3.js**: Advanced data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **ShadCn UI**: Component library for consistent design
- **Next.js Context API**: Application state management

### Data Management

- Mock database implemented as structured JSON files
- Data fetching layer with simulated API endpoints
- Separation of test case metadata and visualization data
- Efficient data transformation for D3.js rendering

### Responsive Design

- CSS Grid/Flexbox for adaptive layouts
- Media queries for breakpoint-specific styling
- Mobile-first approach ensuring cross-device compatibility

## Getting Started

The application can be run locally with standard Next.js commands after installing dependencies. Mock data is preloaded, enabling immediate visualization of test cases without external services.

## Customization

The theming system allows for easy brand alignment while maintaining the core dark aesthetic. Data visualization components can be extended to support additional chart types as requirements evolve.
